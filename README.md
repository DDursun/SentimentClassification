## Happy or Sad? Sentiment Classification using CNNs

This notebook demonstrates the classification of facial expressions into "happy" or "sad" categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project involves:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loading images from a dataset.
   - Cleaning and validating the image formats.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Scaling images and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Model Building and Training**:
   - Constructing a CNN architecture.
   - Training the model with the training set and validating it with the validation set.

4. **Evaluation and Testing**:
   - Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
   - Testing the model on new images to predict facial expressions.

5. **Saving the Model**:
   - Saving the trained model for future use.
